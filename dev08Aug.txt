Routing in Angular
------------------
A included library that is present with Angular project/workspace creation. We have basic routes as app.routes.ts -- similar to binding the routes inside react App.jsx
<Routes>
    <Route .../>
</Routes>

app.routes.ts:
---------------
//* all the routes created here, are passed into app.config.ts as routes into provideRouter(route)
export const routes: Routes = [
    //* url for the components
    // routes are objects, we can specify with some parameters
    // {
    //     path: 'admin',
    //     component: HeaderComponent
    // },

    //* default-route
    // {
    //     path: '',
    //     redirectTo: '', //? specify the pathname here
    //     pathMatch: 'full', //? path-matching strategy: full, prefix
        //? full looks like: localhost:4200/pathname
       //? prefix looks like: /pathname
    // }
];

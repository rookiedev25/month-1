Pipes in Angular:
------------------
In Angular, Pipes are a way to transform data before displaying it in the template — without changing the actual data in your component.

Think of them as little formatting tools you can attach directly in your HTML.

Why are Pipes used?
To format data for the UI without writing extra code in the component.

To keep templates clean and readable instead of doing transformations inside HTML.

To reuse the same transformation logic in multiple places.

How they work
In HTML, you use the | (pipe) operator:

html
Copy
Edit
{{ value | pipeName }}
The value on the left is input data.

The pipe on the right transforms it for display.

Built-in examples
Angular already provides some pipes:

date → Formats dates

currency → Formats a number as currency

uppercase / lowercase → Changes letter casing

json → Pretty-prints an object as JSON

percent → Formats a number as a percentage

Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<p>Today's date: {{ today | date:'fullDate' }}</p>
<p>Price: {{ 250 | currency:'INR' }}</p>
<p>{{ 'hello world' | uppercase }}</p>
Real-life example / Scenario
Imagine you’re building a food delivery app (like Swiggy/Zomato) in Angular.
Your API returns restaurant delivery time in minutes:

typescript
Copy
Edit
deliveryTime = 18;
Instead of showing 18 in your template, you want "18 mins" every time.
You could create a custom pipe:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({ name: 'minutesFormat' })
export class MinutesFormatPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: number): string {
    return `${value} mins`;
  }
}
And then use it in your template:

html
Copy
Edit
<p>ETA: {{ deliveryTime | minutesFormat }}</p>
✅ This way, you don’t have to manually add "mins" everywhere in your HTML — the pipe does it for you.

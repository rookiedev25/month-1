Life Cycle events:
-----------------
These are some methods that are called in the complete cycle of a component being created and destroyed

Below is the life-cycle:
1. Creation
2. Initialization
3. Change detection
4. Rendering
5. Update (on data change)
6. Destruction (when removed)

ngOnChanges() - called when an @Input() property value changes
ngOnInit() - called once after component Initialization
ngDoCheck() - detect and act upon changes manually
ngAfterContentInit() - called after content projected using <ng-content> has been initialized
ngAfterViewInit() - called after every check of component's view 
ngOnDestroy() - cleanup just before Angular destoys the component

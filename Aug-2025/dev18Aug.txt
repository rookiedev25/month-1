Component communication using @Input and @Output:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Parent → Child (@Input)

The parent passes data down to the child.

The property decorated with @Input() exists inside the child component, but the parent sets its value.

2. Child → Parent (@Output)

The child emits an event up to the parent.

The property decorated with @Output() exists inside the child component, but the parent listens to it.

🔹 Separation of Responsibilities

Child Component

Declares @Input() (to receive data).

Declares @Output() (to emit events).

Parent Component

Supplies data for @Input().

Listens to events from @Output().

✅ Example
child.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `
    <p>Got from parent: {{ childMessage }}</p>
    <button (click)="sendNotification()">Notify Parent</button>
  `
})
export class ChildComponent {
  @Input() childMessage: string = '';     // For parent → child
  @Output() notifyParent = new EventEmitter<string>(); // For child → parent

  sendNotification() {
    this.notifyParent.emit("Hello Parent, I'm Child!");
  }
}

parent.component.html
<!-- Sending data to child + listening to event -->
<app-child 
  [childMessage]="'Hello Child from Parent'" 
  (notifyParent)="onNotify($event)">
</app-child>

parent.component.ts
export class ParentComponent {
  onNotify(message: string) {
    console.log("Received from child:", message);
  }
}

🧠 Think Like This:

Child defines the "doors" → @Input (door to receive stuff), @Output (door to send stuff).

Parent uses those doors → [ ] to send data in, ( ) to receive data out.


Analogy with ReactJS:
Parent → Child (with @Input) = Like passing props in React.

Child → Parent (with @Output) = Like using a callback function passed as prop in React.

Service in Angular = Similar to Context API (or Redux) in React.

Both are used to avoid props drilling.

They make the data centralized and available to multiple components without having to pass it down manually.

👉 In Angular, Services + Dependency Injection give you a very powerful and clean way to share data across components.

For example:

Instead of passing user details through 4-5 components using @Input,

You can create a UserService that stores the user info,

Inject it wherever you need it → done ✅

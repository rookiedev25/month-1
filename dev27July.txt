Angular JS
--------------
- This is a javascript framework that is used for Web-development
- This helps to build single-page-applications -- page doesn't refresh on interaction
- Multiple refresh/load time makes application slow -- these are multi-page applications
- This is developed by Google
- Node installation is essential for development
- Based on Model-View-Controller Architecture
- Angular JS(deprecated) vs Angular are different
- Current Angular version is 19

Why Angular:
------------
- Fast Loading
- Fast development
- Provides a lots of geatures :
    - Validation Library
    - Routing
    - Component Based structure
- Large Community

Angular Core Concepts:
-----------------------
- Components, Services
- Directives, Pipes
- Data-Binding, Event hanadlers
- Http Module, Forms 
- Module- Routing, Animations
- Testing, Building for Production

StandAlone vs NGmodule - angular projects

important-files
app.component.ts -- this contains a decorator @Component
app.component.html
app.component.scss

global files - 
index.html
main.ts
styles.scss


Getting started with Installation: (make sure we have node-installed in system)
------------------------------------
install Angular globally on your machine:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

checking angular version:
`ng version`

creating new-project:
`ng new <project-name>`

start-project/app:
`ng serve -o` // this opens the localhost-with port directly into the browser



main.ts > appConfig.ts > appComponent renders


More about files:
-------------------
export-keyword for a class component: using this keyword helps us to make the component publically available to be called/included into any other part of the code/import any other place in the code

Like if we have some component such as Header and we have exported this, then we can use this in our App.component.ts using import statement

folder-structure
-------------------
very-important:
- package.json: This file has all the details about the project such as angular-version, typescript-version, script-versions, dependencies: devDependencies, dependencies and other required information. here we can add more features using npm-command. 

- tsconfig.json: In Angular, we use TS. This file is used to set configurations for TS. For example, we can set the output directory of the ts-files to be stored, then there are strict mode- which enables some warnings while coding, also there are properties with Echema script target what to use in the project

- tsconfig.app.json: only configures files under src-folder.

- tsconfig.spec.json: used to configure the test-cases for Angular Application

- readme.md: add information about the project, just a normal readme

- package-lock.json: This basically contain configuration information about the packages that are installed while creating the application when we run `ng new app-name` similar to what we have in package.json file. But this is different as this only contain defined properties which should not be updated/locked/un-changed on further npm install commands.

- angular.json: this will carry the configuration with project such as directory information for scource paths, root paths, index-file, typescript files, styles- global, local, app-component

- .gitIgnore: has a list of files that should be ignored while pushing this into some repo

getting inside src-folder:

- index.html: this is the entry point of the application

- main.ts: this is the entry point for typescript file for the project. This also tells which component is to be loaded

- styles.scss: global styles

1. Header-routing 

This was already made few days back while I was doing handson based on learnings from the Routing-module in angular. Today, i got to learn a new thing about routes to make them strict and follow certain active-styles after clicking.

Below is an example of a link:
------------------------------
<li>
        <a [routerLink]="['/']" routerLinkActive="router-link-active"
        [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}">Home</a>
</li>

here the proprety routerLinkActiveOptions helps to mark that component as strictly following the particular route. In our case, this component was loaded as part of home-route with only ["/"] so this appears in all other route-paths. to make it strict, we use this.


2. Wild-card routing / handling 404 pages

  // wild card routing:
  // works with a syntax below: 
  {
    path: "**", // if the user-enterd route is not available in the above listed routes, then load this page for those false-routes.
    component: PagenotfoundComponent
  }

3. Pass data form one page to other

possible ways:
- routerLink 
- button click 
- router

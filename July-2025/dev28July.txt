Interpolation in Angular:
--------------------------
- This is used to show the dynamic data including results from calculated values from JS into HTML-format to render onto the display.

- We can use interpolation to directly show some data on UI, can be done with displaying string, numeric values.

- In case of strings, we can use `string-methods` to actually tweak required display on screen

- There are some limitations in this:
    - You cannot show/render any operations such as increment/decrement for a single value
    - assigning values to any variables declared is not allowed, that throws error


Understanding Angular CLI:
---------------------------
- What is angular CLI: 
This is a tool that helps to develop our web-applications using terminal. Starting from creating component, directives, we can directly create those using terminal itself. Commands help us to develop Angular Application

- How to find all commands - documentations
ng version : shows current installed Angular version
ng help : gets all the commands supported for that angular version acting as a guide
more on documentations - angular.dev 

Components in Angular:
-----------------------
What are Components in Angular
- Components are the basic building blocks of an Angular application. They control a part of the user interface, define its logic, and manage its data. Each component consists of a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles.

How to make Components
- ng generate component `component-name`


Files in a component-folder
----------------------------
componentname.component.ts
componentname.component.html
componentname.component.scss
componentname.component.spec.ts

How to get your component rendered onto main-app:
-------------------------------------------------
- add it's Component-selector into app.component.html file 
- add the component-name as Export-classname into app.component.ts into imports:[`place-here`]

Custom Components in Angular:
------------------------------
These are the components that are create without angular-command.
This helps to eliminate some files that are not required for that component, but can be time-consuming
Decorator: @Component 
add selector: '<add here name>' -- this can again be added into app.component.html 
template: 'html-code'

Functions and button-click
- making button
- defining a Functions
- calling functions on button-click
- calling functions from other functions

What are GitHub Pages?
------------------------
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that allows users to host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.
 GitHub Pages can be used to create websites for project documentation, online blogs, landing pages, and more.

GitHub Pages is free of charge for every GitHub user and is available in public GitHub repositories with a GitHub Free account, plus available in public and private GitHub repositories with a GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise account.

There are two types of GitHub Pages sites: user and organization sites, and project sites. User and organization sites must be stored in a repository named .github.io, where is the personal or organization account name. Project sites are stored in a folder within the repository that contains the project's code.

GitHub Pages supports the use of custom domains as well as the change of the root URL to any sub-domain you own.
 Additionally, GitHub Pages can be configured to deploy content from different branches or subdirectories of a repository.

It is important to note that GitHub Pages does not support server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python. However, it does support static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as Jekyll, a static site generator that converts Markdown files to HTML.

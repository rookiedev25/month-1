React Props
--------------
React Props are simply used for communication among componenets in React app. Component communication is a very essential feature that any framework based on component-driven design should have. 

In a component-drive framework, every single unit of the UI is made up of components. Now, each of these componenets might need to communicate data among themselves.

The Root component is the root of the component tree, it renders the components under it.

This is a basic feature that helps us to send and receive data across the components and render them on the UI.

React Components written as functions are known as Functional Components. While the ES6 components are known as Class Components. Functional components are basically JavaScript functions.

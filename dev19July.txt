Key Learnings:

✅ Type Safety – Why TypeScript shines in catching errors at compile time.

✅ Setup & Basics – Installed TypeScript and wrote my first functions like findSum and sortArr.

✅ The any Keyword – Understood how TypeScript handles any behind the scenes, when it sneaks in, and why explicitly typing parameters and return values avoids hidden bugs.

✅ Functions in TS – Explored void (when functions return nothing) and never (error handling or unreachable code).

✅ Objects – Passing objects as arguments and returning them with proper type annotations.

✅ Type Aliases – Found this particularly interesting as it makes type management more flexible but also requires careful usage.



📝 What’s Next?

Tomorrow, I’ll dive into data structures like Arrays, Union, Enum, and Interface. I suspect I might get confused between Types vs Interfaces, so I’ll explore inheritance and real-world use cases to clear things up.
